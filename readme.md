# About This Module

The Pathfinder Second Edition Unofficial Dark Sun Setting module makes significant changes to the original Pathfinder Second Edition content. My goal is to make the transition from the standard rules and setting to this one as seamless as possible. To achieve this, all links to original content compendiums have been overridden with links to the custom compendiums provided by this module. For example, when you click the Ancestry search button on your character sheet, it will now open the Dark Sun ancestries instead of the standard Pathfinder 2e ancestries.

**Important**: One area where I couldn't implement this change is in the Compendium Browser. The GM for this game should go into the browser’s settings, disable the normal sources, and enable the Dark Sun sources. This will help prevent confusion by hiding character options and items that aren’t available on Athas from player searches.

Some content is still a work in progress, and I'll update this module as frequently as possible.

# Overview of the Dark Sun Campaign Setting

Welcome to Athas, a world unlike any other.

As you step into this brutal and unforgiving landscape, it's important to understand that this is no ordinary Pathfinder setting. Athas is a dying world, scorched by an unforgiving sun, and dominated by powerful Sorcerer-Kings. Survival here is everything, and the following are a few differences from other campaign settings that you'll want to keep in mind:

* **Elemental Powers**: Traditional gods are absent here. Instead, people draw their power from the elemental forces of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, as well as the destructive paraelements of Magma, Rain, Silt, and Sun. The Sorcerer-Kings also serve as deific figures, wielding vast power and ruling with an iron fist.

* **Limited Resources**: Athas is a wasteland where metal is exceedingly rare, and most weapons and tools are crafted from bone, stone, and wood. Magic items are feared and outlawed, and ceramic coins replace the gold and silver currencies of other realms.

* **Psionics Over Magic**: Nearly every living thing on Athas possesses latent psionic power. Magic, especially arcane magic, is feared and outlawed due to its destructive impact on the environment. Preservers use magic carefully, while Defilers rip power from the very life around them, leaving destruction in their wake.

* **Survival is Key**: Resources like food and water are scarce, and starvation and thirst will be real threats to your party. You’ll need to scavenge for food, manage limited resources, and contend with the harsh environment as you journey through the wastelands.

* **Strange Powers**: You will have access to unique features such as Wild Talents, which grant additional psionic abilities, and an array of modified backgrounds and ancestries to reflect the world of Athas.

* **Unique Classes and Equipment**: Not all classes or subclasses are available in this setting. Powerful magical weapons are rare, and metal is valued beyond measure. You'll often fight with bone and obsidian weapons, each with their own unique properties and drawbacks.

Athas is not a world of heroes in shining armor. Here, survival comes first, and morality is often dictated by necessity. So gear up, brace yourself for the heat of the crimson sun, and remember: in Athas, only the strong endure.

Good luck. You'll need it.
